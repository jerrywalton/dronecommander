POC for drone mission planner, tool to calculate an overall risk for a drone mission using wizard style mission survey (standard military grade assessment, to done by the PIC).  tool to review and conduct mission shot sequence based on guided shot list (specific to cell tower inspection).  tool to plan a hot point mission (convert from touch to google map coordinate).

overall assessment: it's a proof-of-concept (POC).

know issue: popover view to allow user to select hot-point for hot point mission is broken.
